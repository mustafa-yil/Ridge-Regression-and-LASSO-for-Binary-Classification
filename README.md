# Ridge-Regression-and-LASSO-for-Binary-Classification
This project implements Ridge Regression and LASSO for binary classification on the MNIST dataset, specifically distinguishing between digits '7' and '9'. The performance of these regression models is compared against Linear Regression, evaluating their convergence rate and classification accuracy.
